# key_pressing_sounds

This is just a basic python code which creates clicking sound when you click the keys on the keyboard. 
yeah .. it has some delay because it is not the correct procedure to produce a clicking sound .. Okay yar.. but still it works ! 

make sure to keep the file in the same directory 
you can clone the repository or if you are from linux and if git is installed on ur system then after opening terminal 
use  git+ 'THe url which is will be displayed after clicking the code button ' and that will clone the repository at a directory where you are now.
